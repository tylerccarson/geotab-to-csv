To-dos:

  -make sure to filter out inactive devices -- for example: TRUCK-SY (32000 miles), Durango, Paul's Test Unit
  -improve error handling
  -promises bug on first-time request for any DB
  -testing, CI
  -moving client to an Electron desktop app could also cut out the Google Drive middle man
  -bug that restarts the web server every time the cron job runs

Add a column MeterTitleName with placeholder of Odometer
  -check to subsitute in the name of where reading came from instead of just odometer

Possible to turn into Electron App? Need it to restart or set error message when it doesn't work over a specified period of time
Set static folder location
Only works while open
